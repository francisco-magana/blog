# Who I am?

My name is Francisco Maga√±a. I'm 23 years old.

Software engineer with over three years of experiencie in web development.

Currently I'm working at Nexu, a mexican startup.

My day-to-day technologies are `Typescript`, `Javascript`, `Angular`, `HTML`, `CSS/SCSS`, `Node.js` and `Ruby On Rails`. But I like to learn new tools, frameworks and languages everytime I can.

## A little more

Like many other developers, my journey began with video games **I absolutely loved them**. When I was in high school, I had this ambitious idea of creating the best video game ever made. It would feature over three hundred dungeons, an epic storyline rivaling any RPG, a plethora of weapons, meticulously crafted maps, multiplayer modes, expansions, and the best part was that it would be free. Of course, it was an impossible dream, but I decided to give it a shot. That's how my coding journey began. I learned from YouTube tutorials, PDFs, online resources and ancient scrolls. But at that time I didn't know that I was coding, for me it was "**I'm making videogames**".

When I entered college and my first professor introduced us to a simple sum method in the C language, I was captivated. Those characters with colors, those symbols‚Äî they resembled the ones from video games. It dawned on me that what I had been doing for the past two years was coding.

The journey from there was relatively smooth. I had learned a lot before college, which gave me a sense of confidence and freedom. I seized the opportunity to further enhance my skills and acquire more knowledge. I joined the VEX robotics club, took part in coding tournaments, and even undertook projects for fellow students in exchange for compensation.

I absolutely loved my time at university.

## Teaching

During my college years, I worked as a teacher, where I imparted the fundamentals of the Microsoft Office suite to students of various age groups. It was during this time that I discovered my passion for teaching. I genuinely enjoy explaining concepts and sharing knowledge with others. It's incredibly satisfying, and there's a great sense of fulfillment when someone expresses gratitude for the help provided.

## Hobbies

I like to play videogames, code personal projects, listen to music (I have only one list, the liked songs one, in spotify with 664 songs at this moment) and overthink :)

And that's it for now. I'll be continually updating this about page over time to help you get to know me better. I hope you enjoyed learning more about me, if not, sorry, now you know.
