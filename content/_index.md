# About me

I'm a software engineer from Chiapas, Mexico, passionate about continuous learning in software development, exploring new technologies, and enhancing my soft skills.

I'll be covering a wide range of topics that pique my interest, including tutorials on various subjects, project breakdowns, and even some personal reflections, like video game reviews. Feel free to explore. I hope you find something that captures your interest.

# This site is my digital garden 🌳

Digital gardens are spaces for cultivating your knowledge while learning in public. As an experiment and as an incentive, I embarked on this project. Inspired by other creators, I have chosen to publish my notes here.

Here's how it works:

I have two main sections: **garden** and **posts**. There is a distinction between these two sections:

* **Garden**: Entries in the garden section are work in progress, personal notes or ideas. They will evolve over time, and I will continue to enhance their content.
    * In each note you will find the next emojis:
        * 🌱: Means that the article contains a basic idea or piece of information, maybe work in progress.
        * 🪴: Indicates that I have invested time in writing and researching the entry, making it more detailed and complex than a 🌱 post.
        * 🌳: Signifies that the information is complete, accurate, and well-structured, more complex than 🌱 or 🪴 posts.
    * I will be adding additional indicators at the beginning of each article to provide information about its current status.

* **Posts**: These are the results of the notes from the garden. They are complete blog posts that have grown from the ideas in the garden. In this section, you will find well-structured ideas, tutorials, and essays.

# Important Note from the Garden Section

## I Could Be Wrong

As I mentioned earlier, entries in the garden represent my learning process, and as I learn, I might make mistakes. Therefore, please be patient, and as I gain more knowledge about a topic, I will correct any inaccuracies. Everything in the garden is a work in progress, and I'm willing to revise or rephrase things that no longer align with my current understanding.

## The Blogs Are the Main Source of Information

If you're looking for complete articles and are not particularly interested in my learning journey, you can skip directly to the "Posts" section. I can assure you that the information in that section is accurate and well-structured.

## Take Your Time to Explore the Garden

However, I encourage you not to rush directly to my posts. Take some time to explore my notes and watch my garden grow alongside me.
