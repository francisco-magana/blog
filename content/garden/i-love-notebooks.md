I have loved notebooks since I was a teenager (not long ago, I swear). I don't know why, but every time I see a beautiful notebook design, I want it. And not only notebooks but pens, post-its, washi tapes, and everything that you can use on paper. I buy things like that every time I can (not so proud of it).

Maybe this all started when I wanted to be a comic book artist. I remember when I bought cheap white paper notebooks and divided every page into six rectangles, with one vertical line at the center and two horizontal lines. I drew a lot of incomplete comics, maybe because I wanted to write great stories without planning them. I only finished one comic in a tiny notebook and shared it with my friends.

But my journey as an artist ended too soon; I stopped drawing at the age of 17, if I'm not wrong.

Then, I discovered something called 'Bullet Journal,' and my love for notebooks increased exponentially. I loved how beautiful that journal could look if you put effort into it. However, it was challenging, and yes, you can keep it minimal, but those Pinterest posts look so incredible that I wanted to replicate them. What a mistake.

After a few months of trying to achieve perfection in bullet journaling, I abandoned it and notebooks for a long time.

# Dark times without notebooks

Well, it wasn't really dark times; I was just joking. However, I did step away from notebooks for a significant period, especially when I entered college, and that endeavor consumed my entire life (Software engineering, you may know).

But my desire to create perfect notes was still there. When I was in classes, I wanted to take perfect and beautiful notes, but I had everything working against me. I had really poor handwriting, lacked coloring skills, and had limited time to add details due to the numerous homework assignments with tight deadlines.

Then my notes became a mess, and I lost control of them. My homework didn't look beautiful anymore, but I discovered that ***simplicity is okay***. Something simple and functional is better than something beautiful and complicated.

After a couple of semesters, I didn't need to write anymore; all my homework and exams were digital, so I forgot about note-taking, journaling, and writing.

## Job and productivity

When I finished college, I started working, and another obsession entered my life: ***productivity***.

I wanted to be very productive in what I was doing, like finishing as many tasks as I could, tracking my time to know how much I was spending on certain types of tasks, and trying to optimize it. It wasn't very toxic, but I liked being productive because it made me feel better. With the passage of time, I became less stressed about productivity and more relaxed but still eager to do many things because I like to make the most of my time.

Now, my love for notebooks has returned, but with a superpower. When I was studying, I couldn't buy as many notebooks as I wanted, but now that I am working, I can buy as many as I want (don't be scared, I don't buy 100 notebooks a week, but quite a few in a month). I love the idea of starting to write in them again, becoming more productive, letting my imagination flow, and writing about everything I want.

## Searching for the productive way

Today, I'm starting to use my notebooks for something that makes me more productive. I am going to begin testing some productivity systems in my notebooks and write things that I want to write and do things that I want to do with them. I will write more articles about the development of my productivity notebook system (that is my objective: to develop my own productivity system that makes me feel productive and happy with what I am doing).

Maybe it will take some time, but I love notebooks, so that will not be a problem.

My main focus is to make this system simple and the design minimal, to spend less time planning and designing it, and to put more effort into what really matters.

Hope you find my other related articles (when they are published) interesting.
