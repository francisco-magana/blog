I have read on many sites before that one useful technique for overcoming procrastination is to work on the task you want to complete for at least 5 minutes. After that, you will be concentrated enough to go through the entire task without noticing. I thought that this wouldn't work before because I believed that 5 minutes wasn't enough to get hooked on a task. I thought if you weren't motivated by the task, it wouldn't work. But over the last few months, without even noticing, it started happening.

It all started when I decided that I want to do more projects to start creating new things in my free time, because I really want to build useful stuff. I really like developing software and it is a useful way to practice. But I was not motivated enough because I always wanted to develop a perfect application with the perfect idea (and that idea or app will not come doing nothing). So I decided to start doing more projects that, first of all, make me practice building with different technologies and secondly, getting better ideas from what I am doing.

For 2 weeks, I had in my mind the idea of building a dictionary application using React and a [free dictionary API](https://dictionaryapi.dev/). When I was working, I always said that I would do this at night, but due to a lack of motivation, I postponed it every day. One day, I decided to start with the basic structure of the project just because I had this idea stuck in my mind. When I started working on it, I spent 5 minutes doing basic React configuration and then I got hooked.

I worked all evening/night on this project and managed to get a simple version 1 working in 3 hours. A simple project like this had been postponed for 2 weeks. Then, when I decided to start working, just 5 minutes were enough to get me in the zone and coding fluently and motivated.

I don't know if it will work every time because every project, idea, and situation are different, but I can guarantee that this productivity tip can work under the right conditions. So, if you have something that you want to do and you don't have the motivation to start working on it, spend 5 minutes (or more if you want, the idea is to spend a short amount of time) focused on your task and try to get in the zone to advance in your project.

Now I plan to do this every time I feel unmotivated with a task, hoping that this 5 minutes helps me to start working fluenlty on something that I want to do.
