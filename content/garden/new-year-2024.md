Today is the beginning of a new year. Everyone feels excited about a new year because it is a time to make changes in your life and become the person you want to be.

In my case, every year I set purposes, objectives, habits, and goals that I forget to accomplish, leading to a loss of motivation. I observe this pattern not only in my own life but also among friends and family. Staying motivated can be challenging, especially when facing the need for difficult changes. Often, we may start with great enthusiasm; for instance, some people declare that they will begin working out this year, only to abandon their plans after a few weeks.

I decided that this will be the last year this happens to me. I am tired of pondering a change in my life. The past year (2023) taught me a lot, and I started things that I want to continue doing. I realized that I can do this; it happened during the year without planning. Why not make it happen intentionally?

So, if you experienced something in your year that makes you feel good, excited, or happy with your life, take that moment and think: 'I like that these kinds of things happen to me; I need to do something to keep these things happening when I want.'

Have a nice year and keep it up!
