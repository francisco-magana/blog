Sometimes I tend to overthink and by **sometimes** I mean everytime.

If I want to do something I think too much about how do I want to do it, the perfect time, the perfect shape, the perfect color, the perfect place, where I going to publish it? Who will use it? Someone is going to see it? What if no one see it? How many days I will be working on it? Is it whort it the time? The effort? And soooooo more.

This is the project where I aim to break free from overplanning and overthinking personal projects and just start doing. And perhaps it will serve as a signal for you to do the same. Stop thinking too much about what you want to do and just start doing it. I know we are capable of that and more.

Writing is not one of my strongest skills, and doing it in English (which is not my native language) has its challenges. However, when I got this idea, I knew it would be my opportunity to practice and improve. The important thing here is that I have just started. And that makes me happy.

As the title of the entry says, the hardest thing is getting started. Hope you enjoy my blog.
